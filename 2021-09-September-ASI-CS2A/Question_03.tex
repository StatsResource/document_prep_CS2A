ii)
If no claim- arrangement 1 gives the best result
If claims is 150- arrangement 3 gives the best result
If claim is 200 or 250 - arrangement 2 gives the best result
So the strategy for Reinsurance depends the claims and not dominated by any one.

(i)
iii)
The maximum losses for insurer are
1. 190
2. 100
3. 147.5
So lowest loss is for arrangement 2 so the arrangement 2 is the minimax solution.
