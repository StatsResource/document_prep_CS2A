Q. 8) A sports training team is set up of 50 members. From the training, the candidates either
get injured or are moved out of the training (injured), or they moved to some other training
unit (relocated).
These candidates are observed for a period of 24 months, from the date on which these 50
were admitted into the training team. The table below shows the number of injuries and
relocations at different months.
