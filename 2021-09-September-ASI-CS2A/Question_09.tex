Q. 9) A new insurance company launched certain insurance products in year 2015. As this was
a new line of business for it then, it has been using the standard mortality table rates to
price its product and continues to do so since then. Over the years, it has gathered mortality
claims data on its business, which can be used to set its future mortality assumptions.
However, the products team is insisting on keeping the mortality assumptions unchanged
(same as used since 2015) to price its new products. The Chief Actuary has asked to
perform an analysis and validate the suitability of these standard rates.
The table below summarises the experience analysis numbers from the policies sold by
the insurance company and the standard mortality rates it has been using so far

\item Carry out Chi square test at 5% confidence interval to check whether the
underlying mortality for the insurer is same as the standard mortality rates

\item Based on (\item above, state your recommendation.

Solution 9:
i)
The chi-squared test is a suitable overall test.
Test statistic = Σ(𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ−𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠)2𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠

The test statistic ~ Chi square with m degrees of freedom
Here m is the number of age groups, which in this case is 8. We have not calculated any parameters. Hence, m remains 8
The critical value of the chi-squared distribution at the 5% level of significance with 8 degrees of freedom is 15.51
Value of test statistic = 29.32
Given, Test statistic > Critical value, we reject the null hypothesis

ii)
Thus, standard mortality rates are not a good representation of the actual mortality experience and it is recommended that the company performs experience analysis to set its mortality assumptions.
