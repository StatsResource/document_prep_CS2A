Q. 10) An insurance company has a portfolio of two-year policies. Aggregate annual claims from
the portfolio follow an exponential distribution with mean 25. Claims are independent of
each other. Annual premium of 30 is received under the policies. Premiums under the
policy are received at the start of the year and all claims are paid at the end of the year.
Calculate the probability that the insurer is not ruined by the end of the second year,
assuming the insurer started with zero capital at the start of year 1. [6]

If X1 and X2 are the aggregate claims in year 1 and 2 respectively.
To avoid ruin we need, X1 < 30 and (X1 + X2) < 60.
P (X1 < 30 and X1 + X2 < 60) = ∫𝑓(𝑥)∗𝑃 (𝑋2<60−𝑥)300 𝑑𝑥
∫125∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−125𝑥)∗[1−𝑒𝑥𝑝{−125∗(60−𝑥)}]𝑑𝑥300
∫125∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−125𝑥)−125∗𝑒𝑥𝑝( −6025)𝑑𝑥300
−𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−3025)−3025∗ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−6025)+1
= 0.589944
