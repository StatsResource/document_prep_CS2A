\item  An elevator can lift 600kg. 4 men and 4 women are in the lift. The mean mass of males is 80kg with a standard deviation of 20kg, the mean mass of females is 65kg with a standard deviation of 15kg. Assuming the weights of these individuals are independent and approximately normally distributed, estimate the probability that the elevator will lift these passengers. 

Note: 1) Use the results regarding the sum of independent, normally distributed random variables. 
2)The sum of the masses of the males is the sum of 4 random variables.



\item Suppose X has the following cumulative distribution function. F(x)=0, for x≤0, 
F(x)=1, for x≥5 and F(x) = x3/125 for 0≤ x ≤ 5. Derive E(X) and Var(X).




\item A coin is tossed 100 times. Using the appropriate approximating distribution, estimate the probability that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item exactly 46 heads are thrown
\item  between 48 and 59 heads (inclusively) are thrown.
\end{enumerate}

\item



\end{enumerate}
