\subsection*{Question 5}
A sample of 100 individuals were asked which product they prefer and the results were as follows:  \\[-0.2cm]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccccc|c|}
\hline
&&&&&&\\[-0.3cm]
 & Product 1 & Product 2 & Product 3 & Product 4 & Product 5 & $\sum$ \\[0.1cm]
\hline
&&&&&&\\[-0.3cm]
Frequency & 19 & 24 & 24 & 14 & 19 & 100\\[0.1cm]
\hline
\multicolumn{7}{c}{}\\[-0.3cm]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf(a)} If there was no difference between products, what would the expected frequencies be? \quad \\{\bf(b)} Test the hypothesis that the observed matches the expected \mbox{(use $\alpha=0.05$)}.
