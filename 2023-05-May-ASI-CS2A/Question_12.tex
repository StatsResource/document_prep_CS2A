Q. 12)
\item  Consider the multivariate time series represented by the following pair of equations:
Xt = 0.7 Xt-1+ 0.4 Yt-1 + etX
Yt = 0.1 Xt-1+ 0.2 Yt-1 + etY
where etX and etY are independent white-noise processes. Using eigenvalues, state whether the process is stationary or not.

\item   Consider univariate process:
Xn= 0.8 Xn-1- 0.4 Xn-2+en
where en is a white noise process.
Calculate values of autocorrelation function at lag 1, 2 and expression for autocorrelation function at lag k (k>2).

\item   Two time series X and Y are defined by the equations:
Xt= 0.55 Xt-1+ 0.45 Yt-1 + etX
Yt= 0.45 Xt-1+ 0.55 Yt-1 + etY
where etX and etY are independent white noise processes.
Show that X and Y are cointegrated, with cointegrating factor (1,-1).

Solution 12:
\item 
Calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix:
(0.70.40.10.2)

i.e. we need to determine the value of \lambda for which ‚ÖÜ‚Öáùë°(0.7‚àí \lambda0.40.10.2‚àí \lambda)=0

‚ûî ( 0.7- \lambda) * (0.2- \lambda)- 0.04 =0
‚ûî 0.10- 0.9 \lambda + \lambda2 =0
\lambda = 0.77 or 0.129

Since both the eigenvalues are strictly less than 1 in magnitude, the process is stationary.


\item  
The autocovariance at lag 1 is :
Œ≥1 = cov (Xn, Xn-1)
= cov (0.8 Xn-1- 0.4 Xn-2+en, Xn-1)
= 0.8cov (Xn-1, Xn-1) - 0.4cov (Xn-2, Xn-1) + cov (en, Xn-1)

Œ≥1 = 0.8 Œ≥0 - 0.4 Œ≥1
ie. 1.4 Œ≥1 = 0.8 Œ≥0
ÔÅ≤1 = Œ≥1/ Œ≥0 = 8/14

The autocovariance at lag 2 is:
Œ≥2= cov (Xn , Xn-2)
Œ≥2 = 0.8 Œ≥1- 0.4 Œ≥0

ÔÅ≤2 = Œ≥2 / Œ≥0

So, ÔÅ≤2 = 0.8 ÔÅ≤1 - 0.4
ÔÅ≤2 = 8/10 * 8/14 ‚Äì 4/10
= 4/5 *4/ 7- 2/5
= 16/35 -2/5
= 2/35

In general, for k>2,
Œ≥k= cov (Xn , Xn-k)
Œ≥k = 0.8 Œ≥k-1- 0.4 Œ≥k-2

ÔÅ≤k = Œ≥k/ Œ≥0

Therefore,
ÔÅ≤k= 0.8 ÔÅ≤k-1 - 0.4ÔÅ≤k-2

\item  
To show that the processes X and Y are I(1):
From the first equation:
Yt-1= 1/ 0.45* [ Xt ‚Äì 0.55 Xt-1 - etX ]

Using this in the second equation,
1/ 0.45* [ Xt+1 ‚Äì 0.55 Xt - et+1X ]= 0.45 Xt-1 + . 0.55/ .45 * [ Xt ‚Äì 0.55 Xt-1 - etX ] + etY

This simplifies to:
Xt+1 = 1.1 Xt - - 0.1 Xt-1 + et+1X - .55 etX + 0.45 etY
Equivalently,
Xt = 1.1 Xt-1 - 0.1 Xt-2+ etX - .55 e-1X + 0.45 et-1Y

The characteristic polynomial of the AR part of this equation is:
1- 1- 1.1 \lambda + 0.1 \lambda2 = 0
2- ‚ûî \lambda = 10 or 1
3- The roots of this equation are 10 and 1. Since one root is equal to 1, X is not stationary.

4- Differencing once will eliminate the root of 1. Since the only root is strictly greater than 1 in magnitude X is I (1).

5- The process of Y is may be expressed as a linear form of I(1) process X and etY, therefore, Y is also I (1).

Now to verify if: X-Y is stationary:
Xt- Yt = 0.1 Xt-1 ‚Äì 0.1 Yt-1 + etX ‚Äì etY
Setting Wt = Xt ‚Äì Yt,
The process is AR (1) since the root of its characteristic equation is 10 and this is greater than 1 in magnitude.

Therefore, Wt is stationary, Xt ‚Äì Yt is also thus stationary and X and Y are cointegrated, with cointegrating factor (1,-1).
